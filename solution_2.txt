Task 2 - Value Iteration

Answers:


6) 	Rounds of value iteration for start state to become non-zero: 10
    Why? The agent only gets a non-zero reward for the goal state, therefore only the value function of this state becomes non-zero in the first iteration.
The information then passes 1 filed per iteration and therefore needs 9 more iterations to reach the start state because there are 9 transitions between the goal and the start state.

7) 	Which parameter to change: noise
	Value of the changed parameter: 0.016954

8)	Parameter values producing optimal policy types:
	    a) -n 0 -d 0.1
	    b) -n 0.01 -d 0.1
	    c) -n 0 -d 0.9
	    d) -n 0.2 -d 0.9
	    e) -n 0.9 -d 0.9

9) 	Pros: 								Cons:
		-									- full policy evaluation for each updated policy
		-									- slower convergency to a solution
		-									-
		-									-
